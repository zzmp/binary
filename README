boolean
---

A binary to find the goal value of boolean functions.

`./solver`, when compiled, will iterate through all combinations of an n-length boolean function and, using cplex, find the minimum goal value if possible.

### Compiling

You will need CPLEX Community Edition, from IBM. The Makefile assumes that this is installed in `/opt/ibm/ILOG/CPLEX_Studio_Community127`.

Compile with `make`.

### Running

By default, `./solver` will solve all boolean functions from n=2..8.

`./solver m` will solve functions from n=2..m (m <= 16).
`./solver m1 m2` will solve functions from n=m1..m2 (m1 >= 2, m2 =< 16).

`./solver -e` (or `./solver --export-models`) will also dump `.lp`-formatted models into a `models` folder in the same directory, for inspection.
